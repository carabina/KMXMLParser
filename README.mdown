#KMXMLParser

###How to use - Objective-c

1. Drag KMXMLParser.m and KMXMLParser.h into your Xcode project. Make sure to check the "Copy items into destination group's folder" box and add the files to your target.

2. At the top of the class you want to parse the XML file ``#import "KMXMLParser.h"``

3. To parse your file you need to use the following code:

    ``KMXMLParser *km = [[KMXMLParser alloc] initWithURL:url delegate:self]; `` 

    ``NSMutableArray *posts = [km posts];``

4. Your posts array will now contain all the data from the XML. You can access it using the relevent key. For example, if you want the title of the most recent post you would use:

    ``[[posts objectAtIndex:0] objectForKey@"title"]);``  

5. You can also get the ``summary``, ``date``, and ``link`` using the appropriate key.

###How to use - Swift

1. Drag KMXMLParser.swift into your Xcode project. Make sure to check the "Copy items into destination group's folder" box and add the files to your target.

2. To parse your file you need to use the following code:

    ``var parser : KMXMLParser = KMXMLParser.alloc().initWithURL(url) as KMXMLParser`` 

    ``dataArray = parser.posts``

3. Your data array will now contain all the data from the XML. You can access it using the relevant key. For example, if you want the title of the most recent post you would use:

    ``var dict : NSDictionary! = dataArray.objectAtIndex(0) as NSDictionary
      var title = dict.objectForKey("title")
``  

4. You can also get the ``summary``, ``date``, and ``link`` using the appropriate key.
